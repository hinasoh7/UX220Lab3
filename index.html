    <h1>How I Felt About the Movie:</h1>
    <p> I first learned about <i>Chungking Express</i> through a friend I recently reconnected with after many years. Initially, I wasn't very interested in the idea of watching an older movie because I'm so used to modern media. However, seeing as it was a Chinese movie, and my friend endorsed its story quality so much, I decided that watching the movie wouldn't be a bad idea. So I found it online and started to watch as two love stories unfolded before my eyes.

    </p>

    <h2>A Story: A Lovesick Policeman</h2>
    <p> As the movie opens, you see a lady wearing a wig, sunglasses, and a rain coat running away from people shooting at her as a police man He Qiwu describes how love is an unexpected feeling and can always take you on different journeys. For example, he will fall in love with this mysterious woman in the span of 24 hours. After this introduction, He Qiwu tells us about his breakup with a girl named May. In order to cope with the breakup, constantly hoping for him to get paged that she's looking for him, he stands at the phone calling anyone that is connected to her in order to get any information on what she's doing. It is after many, many calls that he finally realizes that she's not looking for him and will never look for him again. He goes to the convenient store every single day for the rest of the month, buying May's favourite fruit, pineapples, in a can, eating only the ones that expire on May 1st, his birthday. He continues to do this for every single day while somewhere else in Hong Kong, a lady is operating a major drug smuggling scheme alongside immigrants who are desperate for a job.

    </p>

    <p> This unnamed woman works hard to complete this trade off by creating passports for the transporters, arming herself in case things were to go wrong, and ensuring that she is always kept busy to make sure everything runs smoothly. During her side of the story, we come to the understanding that she wears her sunglasses and rain coat no matter the weather because you never are to know when it is going to rain or be sunny. It is through this line that we come to a better understanding that her life is constantly at risk and she is always preparing herself for any mishaps that may happen and cause her trouble. She is always in a flight mode when it comes to conflict, so when it is revealed that the whole operation was just a set up, the woman runs away, hoping to find refuge from the people set on killing her to get rid of evidence.

    </p>
    
    <p> After running for so long, the unnamed woman ends up at a bar, not knowing what her next step to take is. Here, He Qiwu is also at the same bar, drinking his sorrows away as it has now become May 1st and has faced the reality that his ex-girlfriend, May, will no longer look for him. After making a deal with himself that he would fall in love with the next woman he encounters, the unnamed woman entered his vision. He decided to approach her, trying to speak different languages in order to catch her attention. This doesn't work until the third attempt while she continues to tell him to leave her alone. His persistence caused her to finally respond to him, and after a long conversation and drinking competition, the unnamed woman followed He Qiwu into a hotel room. Their relationship does not progress any further here as she then passes out on the bed while He Qiwu orders room service throughout the night while watching shows on the television. As dawn approaches, he decides to help her feel more comfortable by taking her shoes off and shining them, before leaving her after paying for the room. Ironically, He Qiwu was fated to fall in love with a criminal, but their love is to never come into fruition.He goes back to the usual shop that he always gets take out from and asks the owner for advice. He tells He Qiwu to stop dwelling on the past and to move onto other girls because May is not the only woman in the world. After pointing to his new worker, he tells He Qiwu to go after Faye, his cousin. After waking up, the unnamed woman decides to go after the drug lord who set her up, killing him for revenge. As she runs away from her pursuers after the murder, there is a transition back to Faye at the shop.

    </p>

    <h2>B Story: The Police Man, Flight Attendant, and Fast Food Worker</h2>
    <p> As Faye begins to adapt to her new position, working for her cousin, her encounter with He Qiwu does not phase her as he is not the one who is able to capture her interest after his heartbreak. In comes another police officer of the nickname Cop 663 from his badge number. At first, she meets him while he is in a relationship, buying a sandwich for his girlfriend back at home. Cop 663 catches Faye's attention as she immediately finds him attractive but is not the type to admit it to herself at first. As a regular customer, he always buys the same sandwich for her, but the boss suggests for him to buy a different type of sandwich to see if she would like it better than the one he always buys for her. He decides to follow the boss' advice and buys the sandwich for his girlfriend, coming back to report that she indeed did like the new choice better than the old. In a way, this change in sandwich choice was symbolic of her leaving him for someone else, causing Cop 663 to become listless as his daily routines continue. We get exposed to scenes of Cop 663 talking to old or broken stuffed animals and different objects around his home, as if he was talking to a friend who was going through a rough breakup to mirror himself.

    </p>

    <p> A few days pass by and the cop is nowhere to be seen, but a mysterious lady saying that she's a friend of his has come with a letter for him. Being nosy people, the boss and Faye each take turns to privately look at the contents of the letter, knowing that it's a breakup letter with keys to his apartment. When Cop 663 comes by again during his shift on another day, Faye tries to give him the letter but he refuses to take it and asks to take it another day. Not taking the letter showed that the cop was still hung up on his ex and did not want to let go of the memories he had of her yet. After a short trip to the marketplace, Faye, tasked with the goal of paying the electricity bill, encounters Cop 663 on break with his other officers, eating at a restaurant. This encounter leads to him inviting her to drop by his place sometime as he lives very close by for a little chat. Instead, Faye gains the idea of wanting to cheer up the person that she has come to love by going to his house and cleaning things up in order to help him slowly move on from his ex.

    </p>

    <p> Although she was breaking in and entering, Faye consistently visited the cop's apartment to clean up dirty and broken objects, as well as hiding his ex girlfriend's work uniform that she left behind. Showing how absent minded he is, the cop is unable to notice these small changes but comments on how everything is changing but they shouldn't be sad about it. He slowly comes to the realization that he is starting to feel better and it is through this that he is able to move on from his past love, even though it is not fully. However, Faye was not careful enough and got caught being in his apartment, only for her to pretend that she was in the area to buy fish, holding the fish that she was going to put in his fish tank. He doesn't believe her at first because there is no way she was buying fish in his apartment, but he allows for it to pass and lets her go back. However, seeing as she had already failed once, she was not careful again and had to escape his apartment after being caught.

    </p> 
    
    <p>Refusing to see him again, Faye runs away and finally pays the electricity bill. When Cop 663 comes to look for her to take her out on a date to a bar called California, which she accepts. However, as their agreed time approaches, Faye is nowhere to be found. It is then that her cousin comes in to inform him that Faye has left for California, United States, leaving behind a letter for him. At first, his frustration causes him to leave the letter outside in a pile of trash, but after picking it up when it had started to rain, he opened it to find a hand drawn plane ticket. The destination was blurred out, but it only got him curious, looking forward to the date a year later for her to possibly return. It is also around this time that he runs into his ex-girlfriend at the convenience store, conversing with her in a friendly manner to symbolize his current mental state and growth from the breakup. She leaves with her new boyfriend as Cop 663 stands in acceptance.

    </p>

    <p> After a year passed, Faye returns to Hong Kong to her cousin's shop in her flight attendant uniform, only to find Cop 663. She questions why he's there as it was her cousin's shop. He explains that her cousin had actually sold the shop to him and he has been running it by himself. He inquires about her plane ticket that she gave him a year ago, wondering what the destination was. She tells him that she forgot what the destination was, but says that she will make him a new one, grabbing a napkin and a pen. As the scene fades to black, there is an ambiguous end to both stories.

    </p>

    <h2>My Final Thoughts:</h2>
    <p> Despite my initial disinterest, I found myself quite enjoying the symbolism and raw artistry that Kar-Wai Wong displayed in the movie. I really liked that there were ambiguous ends to each story, as it shows how love is unpredictable and there is no right or wrong way a scenario like that can go. It also allows viewers to come to their own conclusions and decisions about the stories. There is also a sequel called <i>Fallen Angels</i>, as Chungking Express was originally three stories in one. However, due to its extensive length, Kar-Wai Wong decided to split the stories into two movies instead. And although I've been sharing my interpretations of the symbolism in the movie, these are all my own personal thoughts and feelings. I greatly advise you to watch the movies yourself if you have any interest in it and see if you can find other meanings in the way the movies were filmed.
